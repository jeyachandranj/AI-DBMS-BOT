[{"role":"user","content":"hi sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Welcome! Thank you for coming in today. Let's get started with the technical round. Can you explain the difference between a primary key and a unique key in a database?"},{"role":"user","content":"\nprimary key means unique value in the table"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Not quite correct. A primary key ensures that the combination of values in a table is unique and serves as a unique identifier for each row. A unique key, on the other hand, also ensures that the values it consists of are unique but doesn't necessarily have to be the identifier for the table.\n\n\nCan you try explaining the purpose of normalization in a database design, and provide an example of a table that might benefit from normalization?"}]
